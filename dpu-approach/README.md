# DPU Approach

To utilize the DPU approach for FPGA-based deep learning inference, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker and the Vitis AI container by following the instructions provided in the [Xilinx/Vitis-AI](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/2.5) repository. This container provides the necessary environment for running the DPU-related tools and workflows.

2. Set up the DPU for the Alveo U250 FPGA platform by referring to the instructions provided in the [Xilinx/Vitis-AI](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/tree/2.5/setup/alveo) repository. These setup instructions provide the specific configurations and steps required to integrate the DPU with the Alveo U250 FPGA.

By following these instructions, you will have the necessary software and configurations in place to leverage the DPU approach for deep learning inference on the Alveo U250 FPGA. Make sure to carefully follow the provided instructions and refer to the respective repositories for any additional details or updates.
